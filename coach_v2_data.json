You achieved a measurable improvement (15% increase in accuracy).\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The answer lacks context: What was the recommendation system used for? What kind of data was it built on?\n2. Limited detail: You didn't explain how you improved accuracy or what specific techniques you used.\n3. No specific challenges mentioned: The interview is looking for examples of overcoming obstacles.\n\n**STAR-based Improvement Suggestions:**\n\nUse the Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR) framework to structure your answer:\n\n1. **Situation:** Briefly describe the project context, e.g., \"Our team was tasked with building a recommendation system for a e-commerce platform using Python and SQL.\"\n2. **Task:** Explain the specific challenge or goal, e.g., \"The goal was to improve the accuracy of the recommendation system by 10%.\"\n3. **Action:** Describe the steps you took to achieve the goal, e.g., \"I used collaborative filtering techniques and optimized the SQL queries to reduce the computational complexity.\"\n4. **Result:** Quantify the outcome, e.g., \"As a result, we were able to improve the accuracy by 15%, increasing customer satisfaction and sales.\"\n\n**Example:**\n\n\"I worked on a team project to build a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform using Python and SQL. The goal was to improve the accuracy by 10%. To achieve this, I used collaborative filtering techniques and optimized the SQL queries to reduce the computational complexity. As a result, we were able to improve the accuracy by 15%, increasing customer satisfaction and sales.\"\n\n**Communication & Confidence Feedback:**\n\n* Speak clearly and confidently, avoiding filler words like \"um\" or \"ah\".\n* Use a moderate pace, pausing briefly to emphasize key points.\n* Make eye contact with the interviewer to build rapport.\n\n**Interview Score:** 6/10\n\nThe answer shows some relevant experience and a measurable achievement, but lacks context, detail, and specific challenges. With the STAR framework and more confident communication, Rohan can improve his answer and increase his chances of acing the interview."}], "created_at": "2026-01-10 20:04:19.341762"}}, "user_profile": {"name": "Rohan", "skills": ["Git, Python, MySQL"], "experience": ""}}
